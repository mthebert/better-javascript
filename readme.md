# JavaScript Examples
While going through some training and writing some examples, I am using this to save working copies of the code.  I will use this repository to periodically 
put up snippets that I want to reference or use again, but aren't complete enough to merit their own repository.

## JavaScript_from_scratch
These files are taken from the Javascript from Scratch course on PluralSight that provided basic examples in writing better js code by understanding flow, functions, objects and truthiness.

## Structuring_JavaScript_code
These files were born from the course on Pluralsight by Dah Wahlin to use better structure in your JS code.

## Pluralsight.com has incredible courses for developers.  Often the same author on an advanced course makes note of concepts he wrote in an earlier course so I am finding it helpful to go through ALL of the courses to not miss anything later.

## License
These are all just snippets that don't do anything by themselves.  Good teaching tools, or examples - but I can't even claim ownership for the ideas on many of them, just putting their code or ideas down on paper.  
Feel free to use them for what they are but nothing more.
